<p>
  <b>Q: What happens at a photo shoot?</b>
</p>
<p>I like outdoor photos and natural light. I usually take photos around sunrise or sunset because that’s when the light is most golden: the light creates a warm and comfortable time for photos, and I always like sparkling hair and smiles against the
  light. Because of this, I would be happy to postpone your photo shoot in case of bad weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: Where are the photo shoots?</b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: Which camera and equipment do you use?</b>
</p>
<p>I love Canon’s soft tone, so I use Canon 5D Mark II bodies, with mostly prime lenses: I love the 50mm/1.2L lens the best.</p>
<p>I use the Contax 645 for film. I am in love with the color of film: tender, soft, and creamy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I still have a Polaroid Camera because it is so much fun to play with!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: How can we prepare for a photo shoot?</b>
</p>
<p>Feel free to contact with me at lymphotography@gmail for specific advice for your shoot. For example, the choice of clothes is very important; I usually suggest wearing clothes that (a) match the environment that you pick, and (b) are simple, so
  that the clothes do not draw attention from you. The color of the clothes depends on the environment, though, so we can discuss that when you contact me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: Can I bring props?</b>
</p>
<p>Sure! I would love that! If you have an even better idea than I do for the environment, please tell me! I love for you to have something memorable and special so that the photos will be more unique and meaningful for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: How long is a photo shoot?</b>
</p>
<p>It depends on which session you pick; portrait sessions run from 30 minutes to 2 hours or more, and wedding session run to 8 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: What do we get from a photo sessions?</b>
</p>
<p>All photo sessions include enhanced high-resolution photos for you to keep the loving moments forever; you will also receive film prints if you select a film session.</p>
<p>Wedding clients receive a fine print photo album in addition to enhanced high-resolution photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: How long will it take to get the photos?</b>
</p>
<p>The average portrait session takes approximately 2 to 3 weeks to edit and deliver, and the average wedding takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks to edit and deliver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: What is your background?</b>
</p>
<p>I am the official photographer for the 2013 and 2014

  </span>. My photos were displayed in the Oh Snap! exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art in 2013, and at the Instagram Show at the Melrose Lightspace in California in 2014.</p>
<p>I am a life lover and a loud laugher. I love origami and DIY projects such as scrapbooking.</p>
<p>I like drawing. I received an honorable mention from Children’s Pictorial when I was four years old. But, after that, my drawing level didn’t improve a lot J</p>
<p>I play some instruments like Erhu and piano, but I can play only simple tunes.</p>
<p>I love flowers; I can spend the whole day hanging around in the garden.</p>
<p>I love to eat and to cook delicious food (that’s why losing weight is my endless job).</p>
<p>Life is beautiful, and I want to capture in photographs the beautiful moments of our life.</p>
<p>I am addicted to beautiful dinnerware and all kinds of cups, Anthropologie, and all kinds of antique stores are my favorite places.</p>
